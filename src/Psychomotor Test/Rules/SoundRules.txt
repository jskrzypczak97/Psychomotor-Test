You will now have to use your ears. In every attempt you will hear
a song played with a different volume value (low, medium or high).
Each time music will be gradually interrupted by one of emergency
sound, siren or horn. You job is to react correctly to those sound
by pressing gas for horn and brake for siren. Again, GAS for horn 
and BRAKE for siren ;)

BRAKE: Left Ctrl
GAS: Right Ctrl

Good luck!
