Your goal is to pick the correct matrix element as quick as you can.
In single attempt two lights will be tuned on, one on the left and 
one on the top.Each time all you have to do is press the button which 
possition is corresponding to those lights. There is going to be thirty 
attempts in total. Cilck 'Training mode' to see how it works.

Good luck!
