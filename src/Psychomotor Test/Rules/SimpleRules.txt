It's very simple. During the test first you will see amber light 
which will be on only for a while. After random amount of time it 
will change for red or green. If it's red you have to hit the brake, 
otherwise the gas pedal. The sooner you react the better!

BRAKE: Left Ctrl
GAS: Right Ctrl

Good luck!
